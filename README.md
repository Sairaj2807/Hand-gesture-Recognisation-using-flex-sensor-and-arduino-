# Hand Gesture Recognition using Flex Sensor and Arduino

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to recognize hand gestures using flex sensors and Arduino. The flex sensors are used to measure the degree of bending in each finger, and Arduino processes this data to identify predefined gestures. This README provides an overview of the project, instructions for setup, and details about the code structure.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Flex sensors (one for each finger)
- Resistors (to create a voltage divider with the flex sensors)
- Connecting wires
- Breadboard or PCB for assembling the circuit

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) installed on your computer
- Basic understanding of Arduino programming and circuitry

## Setup Instructions
1. **Assemble the Circuit:**
   - Connect each flex sensor to the Arduino via a voltage divider circuit.
   - Ensure all connections are secure and follow the circuit diagram provided in the project documentation.

2. **Install Arduino IDE:**
   - Download and install the latest version of Arduino IDE from [Arduino's official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

3. **Upload Code to Arduino:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Copy the provided Arduino sketch (`gesture_recognition.ino`) into a new sketch in the Arduino IDE.
   - Connect your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
   - Select the correct board and port from the Tools menu in Arduino IDE.
   - Click the upload button to upload the code to your Arduino.

## Usage
1. **Calibrate the System:**
   - Before using the gesture recognition, calibrate the sensors to establish the baseline readings for each finger's movement.

2. **Perform Gestures:**
   - Bend your fingers in predefined patterns that correspond to the gestures programmed in the Arduino code.

3. **Interpret Results:**
   - The Arduino will interpret the sensor data and recognize which gesture you have performed based on the predefined thresholds and patterns set in the code.

## Code Structure
- `gesture_recognition.ino`: This file contains the Arduino code for reading sensor data, interpreting gestures, and controlling output based on the recognized gestures.
- The code is structured into setup and loop functions, with additional functions as needed for sensor calibration, gesture recognition logic, and output control.
